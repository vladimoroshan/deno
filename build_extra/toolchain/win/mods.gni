# is honored, so we can use ccache or an equivalent tool.
#
# 'BUILD.gn' was generated as follows (using GNU sed):
#
#   (echo -e '# Automatically generated. See mods.gni.\n' |
#    cat - ../../../build/toolchain/win/BUILD.gn          |
#    sed '0,/import/s|import|import("mods.gni")\n&|'      |
#    sed 's|exec_script("|&$base_toolchain_dir/|'         |
#    sed 's|${goma_prefix}|&${cc_wrapper_prefix}|'        ) > BUILD.gn
#   gn format BUILD.gn

# Ensure the 'cc_wrapper' variable is in scope.
import("//build/toolchain/cc_wrapper.gni")

# Location of the original toolchain definition that this one is derived from.
# Some python scripts that are run by BUILD.gni live here.
base_toolchain_dir = "//build/toolchain/win"

# If cc_wrapper if is set, add a space to it.
