# Cutting a Deno release

## Pre-flight checklist

- [ ] An up to date stable Rust toolchain
- [ ] A binary version of `deno` available (hopefully built from `main`) that is
      going to be available throughout any local building you might do.
- [ ] Forks and local clones of
      [`denoland/deno`](https://github.com/denoland/deno/),
      [`denoland/deno_std`](https://github.com/denoland/deno_std/),
      [`denoland/dotland`](https://github.com/denoland/dotland/),
      [`denoland/docland`](https://github.com/denoland/docland/),
      [`denoland/deno_docker`](https://github.com/denoland/deno_docker/)
      [`denoland/manual`](https://github.com/denoland/manual/)
- [ ] Ensure that external dependencies are up-to date in `denoland/deno` (e.g.
      `rusty_v8`, `serde_v8`, `deno_doc`, `deno_lint`).
- [ ] Ownership access on crates.io for the 19 (ðŸ™€) crates that you will be
      publishing. (Don't worry too much though as the main script publishing 18
      of the crates allows recovery)
- [ ] Lot's of â˜•

**During this process `main` branch (or any other branch that you're creating
release from) should be frozen and no commits should land until the release is
cut.**

Before starting the process write a message in company's #general channel:
`:lock: deno and deno_std are now locked`

## Updating `deno_std`

1. Checkout a branch for releasing `std` (e.g. `release_#.#.#`).

2. Open a PR on the `deno_std` repo that bumps the version in `version.ts` and
   updates `Releases.md`. You can use following command to generate a short list
   that needs to be updated: `git log --oneline <previous_tag>..` (replace
   `<previous_tag>` with actual latest tag, eg. `git log --oneline 0.122.0..`).
   Remove all commits that are not `feat` or `fix`.

3. Before merging the PR, make sure that all tests pass when run using binary
   produced from bumping crates (point 3. from below).

4. When merging the PR, ensure that the commit name is exactly the version name.
   Eg. `0.121.0`, not `0.121.0 (#1810)`.

5. Pull the latest `main` branch and make sure the commit from the merged PR is
   there. Create a tag with the version number (_without_ `v` prefix), eg.
   `git tag 0.122.0 <commit_hash>`, then push the tag to the `denoland/deno_std`
   repository, eg. `git push upstream 0.122.0`.

6. Once CI passes, copy contents of `Releases.md` you added, and create a new
   release on GitHub (https://github.com/denoland/deno_std/releases).

## Updating the main repo

**If you are cutting a patch release**: First you need to sync commit to the
relevant minor branch, so if you are cutting a `v1.17.3` release you need to
sync `v1.17` branch.

To do that, you need to cherry-pick commits from the main branch to the `v1.17`
branch. For patch releases we want to cherry-pick all commits that are not
`feat` commits. Check what was the last commit on `v1.17` branch before the
previous release and start cherry-picking newer commits from the `main`.

Once all relevant commits are cherry-picked, push the branch to the upstream and
verify on GitHub that everything looks correct.

### Phase 1: Bumping versions

1. After releasing deno_std, go to the "version_bump" workflow in the CLI repo's
   actions: https://github.com/denoland/deno/actions/workflows/version_bump.yml

2. Click on the "Run workflow" button.
   1. In the drop down, select the minor branch if doing a path release or the
      main branch if doing a minor release.
   2. For the kind of release, select either "patch", "minor", or "major".
   3. Run the workflow.

3. Wait for the workflow to complete and for a pull request to be automatically
   opened.

4. Review the pull request and make any necessary changes.

5. Merge it.

### Phase 2: Publish

1. Go to the "cargo_publish" workflow in the CLI repo's actions:
   https://github.com/denoland/deno/actions/workflows/cargo_publish.yml

2. Run it on the same branch that you used before and wait for it to complete.

3. This CI run create a tag which triggers a second CI run that publishes the
   GitHub draft release.

   The CI pipeline will create a release draft on GitHub
   (https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases). Update the draft with the
   contents of `Releases.md` that you previously added.

4. Upload Apple M1 build (`deno-aarch64-apple-darwin.zip`) to the release draft
   and to https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/dl.deno.land

   ```
   cargo build --release
   cd target/release
   zip -r deno-aarch64-apple-darwin.zip deno
   ```

5. Publish the release on Github

6. Update the Deno version on the website by updating
   https://github.com/denoland/dotland/blob/main/versions.json.

7. Push a new tag to [`manual`](https://github.com/denoland/manual). The tag
   must match the CLI tag; you don't need to create dedicated commit for that
   purpose, it's enough to tag the latest commit in that repo.

8. For minor releases: make sure https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data has
   been updated to reflect Web API changes in this release. Usually done ahead
   of time by @lucacasonato.

9. **If you are cutting a patch release**: open a PR that forwards all commits
   created in the release process to the `main` branch.

## Updating `doc.deno.land`

This should occur after the Deno CLI is fully published, as the build script
queries the GitHub API to determine what it needs to change and update.

1. Goto the cloned report for `denoland/docland`.

2. Checkout a new branch (e.g. `git checkout -b deno_1.17.0`).

3. Execute `./build.ts` (or
   `deno run --config deno.jsonc --import-map import-map.json --allow-read=. --allow-write=./static --allow-net build.ts`).

4. Commit changes and raise a PR on `denoland/docland`.

5. Merging the approved PR will trigger deployment to Deploy of the updates.

## Updating `deno_docker`

1. Open a PR on the `deno_docker` repo that bumps the Deno version in all
   Dockerfiles, the README and the example Dockerfile
2. Create a tag with the version number (_without_ `v` prefix).

Write a message in company's #general channel:
`:unlock: deno and deno_std are now unlocked`.
